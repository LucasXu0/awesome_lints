/// Comprehensive custom lint rules for Dart and Flutter applications.
///
/// This package provides 128 lint rules to help you write cleaner, more maintainable code:
/// - 65 common Dart lints for code quality and bug prevention
/// - 32 Flutter-specific lints for widget best practices and performance
/// - 22 Bloc-specific lints for Bloc/Cubit best practices
/// - 8 Provider-specific lints for Provider best practices
/// - 1 FakeAsync-specific lint for testing safety
///
/// By default, `custom_lint` enables all rules returned by this plugin. Use presets or
/// explicit configuration to opt-in to a smaller set of rules.
///
/// For detailed documentation on each rule, see:
/// - [Flutter Lints](https://github.com/LucasXu0/awesome_lints/blob/main/lib/src/lints/flutter/FLUTTER_LINTS.md)
/// - [Common Lints](https://github.com/LucasXu0/awesome_lints/blob/main/lib/src/lints/common/COMMON_LINTS.md)
/// - [Provider Lints](https://github.com/LucasXu0/awesome_lints/blob/main/lib/src/lints/provider/PROVIDER_LINTS.md)
